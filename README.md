- Automatically detects and saves cookies in the userâ€™s **Download/CookiesExtractor/** folder, compatible with Android (Termux), Windows, Linux, and macOS
- Includes animated loading spinners and colored terminal output for better user experience
- Automatically delays 60 seconds after every 3 accounts to reduce checkpoint risk on Facebook
- Clean and readable terminal interface with banner and instructions
- Robust error handling with status messages: OK, checkpoint (CP), error
- Cross-platform support with smart download folder detection
- Easy to use with simple input format and clear instructions

## Dependencies

Before running the script on Termux (Android), install required packages:

```bash
pkg update && pkg upgrade
```
```
pkg install git python
```
```
Then install required Python packages:
```
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

How to Install

1. Clone the repository:


```
git clone https://github.com/berlianoel/cookiesids
```
```
cd cookiesids
```

2. Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Instructions

Termux Android Users Only: Setup Storage Permissions

To allow saving files to your device storage, run this once before using the script:
```
termux-setup-storage
```
Grant the requested storage permission in the popup.


**Input Format**

You can enter accounts when prompted with the following format:
```
uid1|password1
uid2|password2
uid3|password3
```
**Example:**
```
600012325678901|mypassword123
600098765432109|examplepass321
```
When entering manually, input one account per line. After entering all accounts, press Enter twice to start the process.


## Output Location

The script will save extracted cookies to:

**<Download Folder>/CookiesExtractor/cookies.txt**

On **Termux** Android, this usually maps to:

/storage/emulated/0/Download/CookiesExtractor/cookies.txt

On Windows:

C:\Users\<YourUsername>\Downloads\CookiesExtractor\cookies.txt

On Linux/macOS:

/home/<YourUsername>/Downloads/CookiesExtractor/cookies.txt


The script tries to detect the correct download folder automatically.

## Important Notes

Make sure to run ```termux-setup-storage``` and grant storage permission before using this script on Termux Android.

The script will retry failed login attempts 3 times per account before skipping.

There will be a 60-second delay after processing every 3 accounts to reduce risk of Facebook checkpoint.

Duplicate accounts already processed (found in cookies.txt) will be skipped.
